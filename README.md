# Fast-Painterly-Style-Transfer
Painterly Style Transfer is firmly established field in the community of computer science problem especially computer graphics. Painterly Style Transfer, expressly, is one of the challenging methods that to render a picture into a painterly style painting. Currently, methods called Non-Photorealistic Rendering and Neural Style Transfer are widespread using in this area are focus on Stroke-based Rendering and Texture Transfer. They both achieved high-quality results in the past few years but were limited by slow and multi-style transfer. To overcome speed constraints and multi-style transfer, this project will explore the style transfer system and achieve them in a fast way from two way which are Non-Photorealistic Rendering and Neural Style Transfer; and compare their results. Moreover, exploring and extruding the possibilities of neural network method in solving style transfer problems during the research.
